Oh, hihway boys all sleeping in

With their dirty mouths and broken strings
D
Oh, their eyes are shining like the sea
Am                     G   C
For you, the queen of San Luis

A bird's eye view of San Luis

```
D
Cutting through the avenues
       C         
I'd always find my way to you
Em                    G      C
Beside the hook, the hammer lies
D
Fumbling round in the smoke
          C
Spending time chasing ghosts
Em             G              C
Hold me down, hold me down, child
Em             G              C
Hold me down, hold me down, child
```

```
Em                 G    C
California called you queen
Em                    G        C
With your golden hair and magazine
C           G             C
Were you somewhere in-between
C                G       C
Fast asleep, a flying dream
```

Chorus:  
(repeat 4x)
```
D
I'm a ghost of you, you're a ghost of me
Am                    G    C
A bird's eye view of San Luis
