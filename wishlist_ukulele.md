I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off

The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top
  F              C           F              C
I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
    F          C                  G               F     F
For 50 million hands upraised and open toward the sky

I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me

I wish I was the full moon shining off a Camaro's hood

I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
